**Before continuing, please, read!**

Even though you have access to all files of this project, it does not mean that you can use them freely. We released the project source so you can see how it was done and maybe learn something from it.

You can use this project's code directly in your own projects or you can study it and adapt/implement your own code, although this project was done in a short period of time and it is a little bit messy (in a bigger project, we would do some things differently, so use the code at your own risk).

But you are not allowed to use the other assets of this game. This means that all audio files, 3D model files and texture files are not meant to be used anywhere else.

**Grandma's Puzzle Box**

A micro game developed for "a sort of game jam-ish" thing that happened in September 2020.

We got puzzle plus Vikings as theme and eleven days to develop the game.

Parts of the game are based on real life events.

Audiovisual is home-made (thank you smartphone technology).



**Disclaimer:** We are not affiliated, associated, authorized, endorsed by, or in any way officially connected with Blind Guardian and Therion.

We are fans of their work and thought it would be nice to include their influence in this project and pay tribute to them.



**What's next?**

We should have used a better resolution for the letters. We might update them later.
